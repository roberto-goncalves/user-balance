Coding Challenge


You are tasked with writing a piece of software to do Checks and Balances.

It must comprise a HTTP Server with two endpoints:

Requirements:

It must not be possible to withdraw money for a given user when they don't have enough balance;
You should take concurrency issues into consideration;

This challenge will be extended by you and a Nubank engineer on a different step of the process;
